[Fishkin’s statistical view is even more alarming than his anecdotal evidence](https://www.slideshare.net/randfish/seo-on-the-serps-brighton-seo-closing-talk/18-The_Scary_PartOrganic_Paid_No). He claims that in February 2016, 58% of Google searches on mobile resulted in organic clicks, and 41% had no clicks. (Some of these may have been abandoned searches, but most are likely satisfied directly in the Google search results.) ^^By February 2018, the number of organic clicks had dropped to 39%, and the number of no click searches had risen to 61%. It isn’t clear what proportion of Google searches his data represents, but it suggests that the cannibalization is accelerating.^^",
